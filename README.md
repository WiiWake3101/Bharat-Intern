# Bharat Intern - Machine Learning Intern

This repository contains the projects developed during my internship at Bharat as a Machine Learning Engineer.

## Projects

### 1. House Price Prediction

In this project, we develop a machine learning model for predicting house prices using Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.

#### Project Structure
- Data Collection: Collecting data related to house prices.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for the model.
- Model Development: Building and training the model using scikit-learn and TensorFlow.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance.

### 2. Movie Recommendations

This project involves building a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering and machine learning techniques in Python.

#### Project Structure
- Data Collection: Gathering movie ratings data.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for the model.
- Model Development: Building the recommendation system using collaborative filtering.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating the recommendation system's performance.

### 3. Iris Classification

In this project, we develop a machine learning model for classifying iris flowers based on their features using Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.

#### Project Structure
- Data Collection: Collecting iris flower data.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for the model.
- Model Development: Building and training the model using scikit-learn and TensorFlow.
